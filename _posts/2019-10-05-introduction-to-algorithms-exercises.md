### 1 The Role of Algorithms in Computing

#### 1.1 Algorithms

> ***1.1-1***
>
> Give a real-world example that requires sorting or a real-world example that requires computing a convex hull.

*Skipped.*

> ***1.1-2***
>
> Other than speed, what other measures of efficiency might one use in a real-world setting?

Memory consumption.

> ***1.1-3***
>
> Select a data structure that you have seen previously, and discuss its strengths and limitations.

[Linked lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list), where insertion and deletion takes constant time, but
locating an element by index takes linear time.

> ***1.1-4***
>
> How are the shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems given above similar? How are they different?

They both need to minimize the total distance for travelling. But shortest-path is to find the shortest path between
only two locations, while traveling-salesman is to find the shortest path containing all given locations.

> ***1.1-5***
>
> Come up with a real-world problem in which only the best solution will do. Then come up with one in which a solution
> that is “approximately” the best is good enough.
